If you've ever designed a workflow you'll know that one of the most common requirements is to integrate various, disparate systems. To make this a little easier, the folks at Activiti created a REST Call Task to integrate simple RESTful service calls into a workflow without writing any code. The video below gives a demonstration on how to build a workflow using the REST Call Task to integrate with a third party web service (in this case, a public weather API).

To use this sample workflow in your own system you need to do the following.
<ol>
 	<li>Set up a local instance of Activiti Enterprise. If you don't have a copy, download the trial here: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.alfresco.com/products/activiti/trial">Activiti Enterprise Trial</a>.</li>
 	<li>
<div>Create an Endpoint. Please note that the Path includes a key value (ab0b268232a61a53) that is for demonstration purposes only. You can create your own at <a href="http://api.wunderground.com" target="_blank">api.wunderground.com</a>.</div>
<code>Name: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weather Service
Protocol:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP
Host:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;api.wunderground.com
Path: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/api/ab0b268232a61a53/conditions/q</code></li>
 	<li>Import the App. You can download it here: <a href="https://jasonjolley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Get-Weather-By-Zip-Code-App.zip">Get Weather By Zip Code App</a>.&nbsp;If you created an Endpoint with the name 'Weather Service' everything should be okay. If you used a different name, you'll have to select the appropriate endpoint in the REST Call Task.</li>
 	<li>Publish the App and add it to your dashboard.</li>
 	<li>Try it out!</li>
</ol>
